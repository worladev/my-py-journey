### The process of converting one data type to another.
# Two types of conversion, implicit and explicit conversion
# implicit is performed automatically by python's compiler to prevent data loss
# explicit is performed by developers by using python functions (str(), int(), float(), ord(), 
    # hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), ...)
